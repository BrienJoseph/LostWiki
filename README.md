It is a bit different than other wikis and that's by design. The thing that really got me back into the community was the open source nature of this project -- and I wanted to utilize a wiki-like backend that could facilitate that.

While there is the ability to sign in with GitHub (and add people who earn trust to contributor/admin/etc), the aspect I leaned into was tying this entire effort to a GitHub project: https://github.com/BrienJoseph/LostWiki

Forking is easier to navigate compared to a single page editing/creation for the most part, and allows for the long term goal of branching the wiki at specific timeframes (2004, 2005, etc) so we can have active branches that continue to grow if and when the LostCity preservation project decided to push forward with the opportunity to keep 2004 frozen in time as a historical artifact.

If anyone's interested, most of my work has been in planning out and scraping pages for population -- with the mindset that we shouldn't be yoinking rsc or osrs wikis 1:1 . 

I think this could be an exciting opportunity to tailor the wiki to use historical resources, directly citing the code from @pazas's wonderful project, and revisiting all aspects of the game as it continues to flesh itself out. I also thought it would be valuable to have a section of the wiki to document the actual project, the code, as well. We all like DPS calculators, I think it could be great to legitimately be able to site the line(s) of code that dictate damage rolls, and so much more. 

If you're interested and want to contribute, whether its sorting article shells, improve upon the aesthetic, or anything else you can think of -- let me know!
