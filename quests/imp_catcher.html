Description:Wizard Mizgog has lost his beads because Wizard Grayzag has summoned many imps and stole all his beads. Can you help Wizard Mizgog?

Difficulty Level:Easy

Items/Skills Needed To Start:None

Starting Location:3rd floor of the Wizard's Tower south of Draynor Village

Reward:375 Magic experience, 1 Quest Point, and an Amulet of Accuracy (+4 Weapon Aim).

    Talk to Wizard Mizgog. He will tell you about he has lost his beads which are read bead, white bead, black bead and yellow bead. He will also tell you that Wizard Grayzag's imp has stolen the beads. Tell him that you will return the beads to him


    You can find some imps next to the room where you are. Kill some imps to get the beads. Be patient. Imps don't usually drop them. If you don't want to kill imps, don't worry. There is another way to get the beads. You can buy beads from players. That will save a lot of time


    After you have collected all the beads, return to Wizard Mizgog. He will reward you
