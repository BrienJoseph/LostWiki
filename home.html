  <strong>Note:</strong> This project is unaffiliated with Jagex, Runescape, Oldschool Runescape, 2004scape. The intent of this is to relive the experience of documenting what the playerbase knows about the game, with a new additional focus on the source code. I would like this wiki to better document how the lostcity scape code works, sources that validate it, and how players can enjoy the end result.

<p>
  This is the project tied to <a class="is-external-link" href="https://lostwiki.org">https://lostwiki.org</a>. Built with Wiki.js as the backend, the wiki is integrated with GitHub to allow better documentation and collaboration. Editors can choose to contribute on the live site via OAuth through <a class="is-external-link" href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a> or they can edit through the project.

</div><h2 class="toc-header" id="starting-point"> Starting point</h2>
<p>
  I didn't want this to just be a clone of an existing wiki; those are existing projects that have either not caught up to, or have long passed the preservation period. To give us a starting point, the skeleton has been derived from pages on the classic wiki, because it feels true to form to transition from Runescape Classic to figuring out what applies and what is different in 2004, 2005, etc. etc.

</div><h2 class="toc-header" id="roles"> Roles</h2>
<p>
  Via <a class="is-external-link" href="https://lostwiki.org">https://lostwiki.org</a>, you can authorize through GitHub and you are given the role of contributor. From there, you can provide edits to existing pages but you will not be able to restructure the current topography. To make the wiki and GitHub project mesh well, directories were a necessary structuring to avoid a flat root with thousands of files.
